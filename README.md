# Tweet Sentiment Analyser

Given a set of tweets called the training data set that is already pre-classified by humans as positive or negative based on their content, analyze the frequency of occurrences of words in the tweets to develop a classification scheme. Using a classification scheme, classify another set of tweets called the testing data set and predict if each tweet has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

Additionally, a string class was implemented from scratch, and test cases where created to check the functionality of the class.
